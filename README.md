<h1> Github Actions Controller </h1>

Github-actions-controller is designed as a central place for github workflows to be managed from. This ranges from linting, testing, building and deploying workflows for code.

Think of it like a easy quick way to get setup with basic workflows, and if you wanted to update them across multiple repositories, this is the place to do so! As its intended as the central place to manage them, rather than going into each repo and updating them one at a time.
